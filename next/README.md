Dachs is a programming language for general purpose.

Goals :dog2:
- Light to write (inspired by Ruby)
- Strongly and statically typed
- Native code efficiency
- Immutability-aware
- Familiar with functional features
- Dog-friendly

Dachs aims a name oriented language. User writes names to describe your program, rather than
writing types. Types are inferred by type inference algorithm and used to verify your code and
auto-generated documentation.

Dachs is under construction. Development is on going. To build a compiler, please read [build instruction][].

Please see [documents][] for more detail.
